# Wreckfest Server Configuration Example
# **************************************

# Note #1: When launching the server, you can override server settings by using command line switch "-server_set [setting]=[value]" with multiple settings separated by a space
# Example: "server\Wreckfest.exe -s server_config=server_config.cfg -server_set server_name=myserver max_players=12 password=secret"

# Note #2: You can set the server save data path by using command line switch "--save-dir=[path]" (notice the two dashes). The path needs to exist, so create the folder beforehand
# Example: "server\Wreckfest.exe -s server_config=server_config.cfg --save-dir=d:\MyServer"
